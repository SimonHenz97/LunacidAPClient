# Introduction to Archipelago

This document will help anyone not familiar with Archipelago find where to go, with some basic pointers.  I won't go through any serious detail, and will refer to Archipelago documents when needed.

Note, I only add this since I plan to not merge this randomizer into main and make this game "supported".  So there will always be a minor difficulty curve (for now) compared to other games that are supported (on the website).

## What is Archipelago?

[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) is a multiworld randomizer API that allows multiple games to be randomized together.  Documentation on how to install Archipelago and general setup can be found [here](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en).  This includes information on hosting your own games either on the provided website or locally.

If you want a basic example of this in action, there's [this series of someone playing every game supported (and then some) all at once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsrsH713qEU), and [another person playing with someone else](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3sbU06qs1Q).


## Is installing Archipelago necessary?

Some games no, but it comes with a text client, which helps with the API's hinting system if you are stuck, among other features.  If you're playing games that need to be patched (ROM games) then yes.

## How do I make a suitable YAML without the website to help me?

There's a useful YAML guide [here](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en).  Note for this randomizer, eventually I want to make a small program in archipelago so you can generate a game more easily without a website.  Its a stand-in for now.

# Minor FAQ

These sort of questions are pretty minor but I feel like are good to address.

## Is joining the Discord server they promote necessary?

Not really, but since Discord makes communities closed off and hard to follow, its not a bad idea for general updates.

## Are there other games being worked on?

There are.  Check the apworlds tab of [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZvn4wSjb633Uxu2o8oHambwP0aAax4XnADidn3xs3g/edit#gid=450876694).

## Can this be played: with multiple people/solo, by myself?

Yes.  I note this since I see it commonly asked.

## Why not merge this game into main for ease of use?

There's some future scope/plans to make a repository structure for AP so apworlds can be put together without much hassle, and games generated with or without a website.  I think its a good idea but a lot of stress currently is on all the games that exist, finding a way to handle it all, and finding people to work on it.  Its a long story, but essentially since I think the whole repository thing is a good idea, submitting it would defeat the purpose.

If you want to make comments/suggestions to code that's fine.  I'm just a baby to this sort of thing though.
