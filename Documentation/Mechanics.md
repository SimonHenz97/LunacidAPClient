# Lunacid Randomizer Mechanics

Listed here are a few things I felt would be a good idea to note for the end user.  Likely will be expanded and changed around as development continues.

## Hints

The Bestial Communion spell has been modified to instead give players hints about random locations in the game, given some flair and obfuscated using the game's cipher and elf runes.  If an item is progression, it will auto-hint for you so you can see it in the tracker, but otherwise you will have to parse it on your own.

## Forbidden Archives Access

The access to this area is logically open by default, as starting as Shinobi alone is enough to give enough SPD and DEX to make the jump.

## Shop Locations (Prices)

Any shop location outside of the Enchanted Key assumes you can at least reach The Sanguine Sea, in order to give you more access to means of collecting funds to purchase them.

## Dying

When you die in Lunacid, the game will disconnect you from the server, to avoid a state where an attempt to send you items fails.  Reviving autoconnects you.

## Switch Locking

The setting "Switch Locks" goes to almost all switch locations in the game, and bars you from using them unless the appropriate switch item has been located.  Some progression markers are obvious, some not so much, so I will note a few:

- **Forbidden Archives (1F -2F) being non-progression**: The elevator starts in a position where you can get on it, and if it was left at the bottom floor it is trivial to reach the bottom without dying.  Its moreso annoying.
- **Terminus Prison Back Alley Switch being progression**: You may not have an alternative way to get back to the starting floor (such as lack of Icarius Flight).
